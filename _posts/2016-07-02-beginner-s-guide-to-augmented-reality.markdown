### What is Augmented Reality

“ Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented (or supplemented) by computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer “ - Wikipedia

When most people hear buzz words such as “Augmented Reality” , “Virtual Reality” , they begin to wonder what they really means. However, when we hear about augmented reality these days it usually refers to a much more sophisticated, interactive and spatially aware implementation of the concept. Where digital objects such as 3D models or video are projected onto our view of reality as if they were really there.

### How Does Augmented Reality Work?

The type of augmented reality you are most likely to encounter uses a range of sensors (including a camera), computer components and a display device to create the illusion of virtual objects in the real world.

Thanks to the popularity of smartphones, which have all the necessary components, they have been the place most commercial augmented reality applications that have been released.
In general the device looks for a particular target. This can be anything, but usually it’s a 2D image printed on something like a movie poster. Once the augmented reality application recognizes the target via the camera it processes the image and augments it in some way with pictures and sound. For example, you may see the movie poster spring to life and play a trailer for the film. As long as you look at the poster through the “window” of the display you can see augmented reality instead of plain old vanilla reality.

By using smart algorithms and other sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes the device can keep the augmented elements aligned with the image of the real world.
Using a smartphone or tablet computer as a “magic window” into the augmented world is one way we can relay this digital info to our eyes, but there are many other ways to achieve this.

### USE CASES OF AUGMENTED REALITY

#### Information overlays
Usually with exhibits and installations, there is a lot of information one wants to give out to the clients but you can’t have it all in a space for either design or practical considerations.
AR gives a nice way for users to explore a space and know more details within about the object. This can be textual information that appears by the object or related video or animations and 3D models.

#### Exploring virtual objects
AR is an interesting way to explore and communicate with customers about virtual objects. You can move the virtual object in space to have a look at it from different angles. You can also put the object in a physical context. For example placing an architecture model on a map or showing furniture in a context of a bedroom.

#### Bringing packaging to life
Activating packaging can be both informative and fun marketing tool when used in a right way. Examples include pop out information for kids on cereal boxes, animating album covers etc. This motivates clients to download your app and interact with your company in an innovative way.
AR has received a nice acceptance from the people worldwide despite it being comparatively new developing technology. Although it is not completely developed, technological experts from all across the world are continuously investing in research and development for better results.
